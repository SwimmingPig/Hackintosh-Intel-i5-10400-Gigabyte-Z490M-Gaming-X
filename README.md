# Bootloader:

Opencore 0.5.9

# Installation Steps:

**Most of these steps comes from the [dortania's](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/) installation guide.** Make sure to read those instructions.

## GibMacOS

> Making a bootable MacOS USB drive from Windows.

1. Run gibMacOS.bat as administrator
2. Press "r" to toggle recovery only
3. Download the most recent full install version
4. Open MakeInstall.bat as Admin and select your drive with option O for OpenCore( ex: 1O).
5. After formatting the disk, copy and paste the path of RecoveryHDMetaDMG.pkg inside the folder of "macOS Downloads" in the "gibMacOS" directory.

## Cleanup Drivers and Tools

- **Remove from Drivers:**

  - OpenUsbKbDxe.efi
    - Used for OpenCore picker on **legacy systems running DuetPkg**, [not recommended and even harmful on Ivy Bridge and newer](https://applelife.ru/threads/opencore-obsuzhdenie-i-ustanovka.2944066/page-176#post-856653)
  - UsbMouseDxe.efi
    - similar idea to OpenUsbKbDxe, should only be needed on legacy systems using DuetPkg
  - NvmExpressDxe.efi
    - Used for Haswell and older when no NVMe driver is built into the firmware
  - XhciDxe.efi
    - Used for Sandy Bridge and older when no XHCI driver is built into the firmware
  - HiiDatabase.efi
    - Used for fixing GUI support like OpenShell.efi on Sandy Bridge and older
  - OpenCanopy.efi
    - This is OpenCore's optional GUI, we'll be going over how to set this up in [Post Install](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/extras/gui.html) so remove this for now
  - Ps2KeyboardDxe.efi + Ps2MouseDxe.efi
    - Pretty obvious when you need this, USB keyboard and mouse users don't need it
    - Reminder: PS2 â‰  USB

  I also deleted crscreenshot.efi, keeping only AudioDXE.efi and OpenRuntime.efi in the folder.

- **Remove everything from Tools:**

  - Way to many to list them all, but I recommend keeping OpenShell.efi for troubleshooting purposes

## Get Firmware Drivers

[Gathering files](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/ktext.html)

- Added HfsPlus.efi for reading Hfs filesystems. In total there are three drivers, AudioDXE.efi, OpenRuntime.efi and HfsPlus.efi.

## Get Kexts

[Kexts Repo](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=!APjCyRpzoAKp4xs&id=FE4038DA929BFB23!455036&cid=FE4038DA929BFB23)

![Kexts](./Images/kexts.png?raw=true)

## ACPI SSDT

[corpnewt/SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)

- Run SSDTTime
- Press 4 for DumpDSDT
- Press 2 for Fake EC
- Copy results excepte DSDT.ami to ACPI folder under EFI/OC

## config.plist

- Download OpenCorePkg's releases.

- Rename the sample.plist file in "Docs" under the OpenCorePkg folder

- Copy the file to "EFI/OC" on the usb

- Download ProperTree and start the program

  [corpnewt/ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)

- Open your config.plist in the app

- And change all configurations mentioned in

  [Comet Lake](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/config.plist/comet-lake.html#pciroot0x0pci0x20x0)

- Use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application to generate SMBIOS info, and add it to config.plist.

Disabled: SetupVirtualMap may be needed depending on the firmware, generally this quirk should be avoided but most Gigabyte users and older hardware(Broadwell and older) will need this quirk to boot.

Added SSDT-AWAC.aml to config.plist

## Bios Settings

**Disable:**

- Fast Boot
- VT-d (can be enabled if you set `DisableIoMapper` to YES)
- CSM
- Thunderbolt(For initial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)
- Intel SGX
- Intel Platform Trust
- CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection) (**This must be off, if you can't find the option then enable both `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` and `AppleXcpmCfgLock` under Kernel -> Quirks. Your hack will not boot with CFG-Lock enabled**) **NOT FOUND**

**Enable:**

- VT-x
- Above 4G decoding
- Hyper-Threading
- Execute Disable Bit
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
- OS type: (Windows 10 Feautres: Ohter)
- DVMT Pre-Allocated(iGPU Memory): 64MB

# Post Installation

1. Boot without USB: Copy the EFI folder on the usb to the mounted efi on main computer using "Mount EFI".

2. Exclude Verbose Mode

   ## Fixing Audio:

   >  Thanks for [rcozinheiro](https://www.reddit.com/user/rcozinheiro/) for the solution.

   Make sure these three kexts are in the EFI:

   - AppleALC.kext

   - FakePCIID.kext

   - FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext

   And edit the config.plist by adding under DeviceProperties -> Add:

   - PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)
     - device-id data 70A10000
     - layout-id data 01000000

   Also make sure removing the alcid argv in the boot settings.
